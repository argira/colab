Welcome to my collab repository
on this repository you will find the google collab notebooks I've been working on.

1 -  ICE reported abuse - with a month evaluation of reported abuses, timeframe from the abuse to when it was reported.
2 - Estudio Salarios SG - SG magazine creates a survey every year to ask about the salaries for different roles, profiles and other in the area of technology, the analysis I performed
   is based on their initial focus on Age, Experience and Gender. I created aditional charts comparing this values against eachother.
